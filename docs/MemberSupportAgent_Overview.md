# Member Support Agent: High-Level Overview

## What This Project Is

This is an **AI-powered customer support system** for a credit union called "Horizon Bay Credit Union." It's designed to help members get answers to their questions about banking services, loans, accounts, and other financial products.

## How It Works (The Big Picture)

### 1. **User Experience**

- A member visits the website and sees a chat interface
- They type questions like "What are your loan rates?" or "How do I open an account?"
- An AI assistant named "Alexa" responds with helpful information
- If Alexa can't help, she escalates the issue to a human support agent

### 2. **Behind the Scenes**

The system has three main parts:

**Frontend (React App)**

- The chat interface you see in the browser
- Handles user input and displays responses
- Connects to the backend to get AI responses

**Backend (FastAPI + AI)**

- Processes user questions using AI
- Searches through credit union documents for answers
- Manages conversations and user data
- Sends notifications when human help is needed

**Database (Supabase)**

- Stores conversation history
- Tracks user information for follow-ups
- Records when issues need human intervention

## The AI Agent (Alexa)

### What Alexa Does

- **Answers Questions**: Uses knowledge from credit union documents
- **Maintains Context**: Remembers the conversation history
- **Escalates Issues**: When she can't help, she connects users to humans
- **Records Information**: Captures contact details for follow-ups

### How Alexa Works

1. **Receives Question**: User asks about loan rates, account opening, etc.
2. **Searches Knowledge Base**: Looks through PDF documents about credit union services
3. **Generates Response**: Uses AI to create helpful, accurate answers
4. **Takes Action**: Records user info, sends notifications, or escalates issues

## Key Features

### **Smart Knowledge Base**

- The system has access to credit union documents (PDFs)
- It can search through these documents to find relevant information
- This ensures Alexa gives accurate, up-to-date information

### **Automatic Escalation**

- When users mention fraud, loans, or complex issues, Alexa detects this
- She asks for contact information (name, email, phone)
- She sends a notification to human support staff
- The human agent gets the full conversation context

### **Conversation Memory**

- Alexa remembers what you've discussed
- She can refer back to previous parts of the conversation
- This makes the experience feel natural and helpful

### **Professional Integration**

- Connects to real notification systems (Pushover)
- Stores data in a professional database (Supabase)
- Designed for production use in a real credit union

## Technical Architecture

### **Frontend → Backend → AI**

```
User Types Question → React App → FastAPI Server → AI Agent → Response
```

### **Data Flow**

1. User types in chat interface
2. Frontend sends question to backend
3. Backend AI agent searches knowledge base
4. AI generates response based on found information
5. Response sent back to frontend
6. User sees helpful answer

### **When Escalation Happens**

1. User mentions fraud, loan issues, or requests human help
2. Alexa asks for contact information
3. Alexa records user details in database
4. Alexa sends notification to support staff
5. Human agent gets full conversation history
6. Human can follow up with the user

## Real-World Use Case

**Example Scenario:**

1. **User**: "I think there's fraud on my account"
2. **Alexa**: "I understand your concern about fraud. I'll connect you with a specialist. Can you provide your contact information (name, email, phone) so they can reach you?"
3. **User**: "My name is John Smith, email john@example.com, phone 555-1234"
4. **Alexa**: Records this information and sends notification to fraud department
5. **Human Agent**: Receives notification with John's details and conversation history
6. **Human Agent**: Can immediately call John to help with the fraud issue
