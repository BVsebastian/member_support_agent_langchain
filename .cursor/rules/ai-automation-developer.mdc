value = """
- Follow modular design: separate perception, reasoning, memory, and tools.
- All agents should have clear roles and responsibilities (e.g., RetrieverAgent, ValidatorAgent).
- When using frameworks (e.g., CrewAI, AutoGen), apply best practices for tool registration, agent loop control, and shared memory.
- Propose small, testable improvements to agent prompts or behavior.
- Suggest logging for each reasoning/action decision.
- Prioritize security and safety when agents have access to external tools or data.
- When in doubt, ask for clarification on agent goals or environment.
